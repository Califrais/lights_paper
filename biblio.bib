The main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. This procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. In this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. The computational burden is then alleviated by using the Gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. Those subsets with higher probability--the promising ones--can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the Gibbs sample.},

These include the nonconjugate SSVS formulation of George and McCulloch (1993), as well as conjugate formulations which allow for analytical simplification. Hyperparameter settings which base selection on practical significance, and the implications of using mixtures with point priors are discussed. Computational methods for posterior evaluation and exploration are considered. Rapid updating methods are seen to provide feasible methods for exhaustive evaluation using Gray Code sequencing in moderately sized problems, and fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration in large problems. Estimation of normalization constants is seen to provide improved posterior estimates of individual model probabilities and the total visited probability. Various procedures are illustrated on simulated sample problems and on a real problem concerning the construction of financial index tracking portfolios.},

Analytic case-control studies are primarily used in this identification stage by comparing exposures in cases and controls using logistic regression. Standard epidemiological analysis practice is not formally defined and the combination of currently applied methods is subject to issues such as response misclassification, missing values, multiple testing problems and small sample estimation problems resulting in biased and possibly misleading results. In this paper, we develop a formal Bayesian variable selection method to account for misclassified responses and missing covariates, which are common complications in food-borne outbreak investigations. We illustrate the implementation and performance of our method on a Salmonella Thompson outbreak in the Netherlands in 2012. Our method is shown to perform better than the standard logistic regression approach with respect to earlier identification of contaminated food products. It also allows relatively easy implementation of otherwise complex methodological issues.},

	isbn = {978-0-470-01823-1},
	abstract = {The growth of biostatistics has been phenomenal in recent years and has been marked by considerable technical innovation in both methodology and computational practicality. One area that has experienced significant growth is Bayesian methods. The growing use of Bayesian methodology has taken place partly due to an increasing number of practitioners valuing the Bayesian paradigm as matching that of scientific discovery. In addition, computational advances have allowed for more complex models to be fitted routinely to realistic data sets. Through examples, exercises and a combination of introductory and more advanced chapters, this book provides an invaluable understanding of the complex world of biomedical statistics illustrated via a diverse range of applications taken from epidemiology, exploratory clinical studies, health promotion studies, image analysis and clinical trials. Key Features:  Provides an authoritative account of Bayesian methodology, from its most basic elements to its practical implementation, with an emphasis on healthcare techniques. Contains introductory explanations of Bayesian principles common to all areas of application. Presents clear and concise examples in biostatistics applications such as clinical trials, longitudinal studies, bioassay, survival, image analysis and bioinformatics. Illustrated throughout with examples using software including WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, SAS and various dedicated R programs. Highlights the differences between the Bayesian and classical approaches. Supported by an accompanying website hosting free software and case study guides.  Bayesian Biostatistics introduces the reader smoothly into the Bayesian statistical methods with chapters that gradually increase in level of complexity. Master students in biostatistics, applied statisticians and all researchers with a good background in classical statistics who have interest in Bayesian methods will find this book useful.},

We review these methods, in the context of their different properties. We then implement the methods in BUGS, using both real and simulated data as examples, and investigate how the different methods perform in practice. Our results suggest that SSVS, reversible jump MCMC and adaptive shrinkage methods can all work well, but the choice of which method is better will depend on the priors that are used, and also on how they are implemented.},

A joint-cure model is developed for this type of data, in which the longitudinal marker and the failure time process are modeled jointly, with a fraction of patients assumed to be immune from the endpoint. A hierarchical nonlinear mixed-effects model is assumed for the marker and a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model is used to model the time to endpoint. The probability of cure is modeled by a logistic link. The parameters are estimated using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. Importance sampling with an adaptively chosen t-distribution and variable Monte Carlo sample size is used. We apply the method to data from prostate cancer and perform a simulation study. We show that by incorporating the longitudinal disease progression marker into the cure model, we obtain parameter estimates with better statistical properties. The classification of the censored patients into the cure group and the susceptible group based on the estimated conditional recurrence probability from the joint-cure model has a higher sensitivity and specificity, and a lower misclassification probability compared with the standard cure model. The addition of the longitudinal data has the effect of reducing the impact of the identifiability problems in a standard cure model and can help overcome biases due to informative censoring.},

Methods for the combined analysis of both kinds of data have been developed in recent years, with the main emphasis being on modeling and estimation. In cancer research it is common for there to be long term survivors or cured patients and methods have been developed to analyze such data. In this article, we review both joint models for the analysis of longitudinal and survival data and cure models. We then present a joint longitudinal-survival-cure model to analyze data from a study of prostate cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. In this model each patient is assumed to be either cured or susceptible to clinical recurrence. The cured fraction is modeled as a logistic function of baseline covariates. The longitudinal PSA data is modeled as a non-linear hierarchical mixed model, with different models for the cured and susceptible groups. The clinical recurrences are modeled as a time-dependent proportional hazards model for those in the susceptible group. The baseline variables are covariates in both the failure time and longitudinal models. We use both a Monte Carlo EM algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to fit the model. The results from the two estimation methods are compared. We focus on both selected parameters of the model and derived interpretable quantities.},

	abstract = {A retrospective substudy of the nutritional prevention of cancer (NPC) trials investigated the utility of longitudinally measured prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a biomarker for subsequent onset of prostate cancer (PCa). Serial PSA levels were determined retrospectively from frozen blood samples that had been collected from all patients at successive clinic visits with the timing and the number of these visits highly variable. Diagnosis dates of all incident cases of PCa were recorded. Heterogeneity in PSA trajectories was observed that could not be fully explained by the usual linear mixed-effects model and measured covariates. Latent class models that incorporate both a longitudinal biomarker process and an event process offer a way to handle additional heterogeneity, to uncover distinct subpopulations, to incorporate correlated nonnormally distributed outcomes, and to classify individuals into risk classes. Our latent class joint model can aid the prediction of PCa probability given the longitudinal biomarker information available on an individual up to any date. The proposed model easily accommodates highly unbalanced longitudinal data and recurrent events. There are two levels of structure in the latent class joint model. First, the uncertainty of latent class membership is specified through a multinomial logistic model. Second, the class-specific marker trajectory and event process are specified parametrically and semiparametrically, under the assumption of conditional independence given the latent class membership. We use a likelihood approach to obtain parameter estimates via the EM algorithm. We fit the latent class joint model to the data from the NPC trials; four distinct subpopulations are identified that differ with regard to their PSA trajectories and risk for prostate cancer. Higher PSA level is significantly associated with increased risk of PCa, but appears to be conditionally independent once the latent classes are taken into account. Among the covariates, selenium supplementation and age at entry are statistically significant for various parts of the model. Assumptions—in particular the conditional independence between the longitudinal PSA biomarker and time to PCa diagnosis—are assessed.},

The MCMs have been extended to bivariate survival data by modeling the marginal distributions. In this paper, the marginal MCM is extended to multivariate survival data. The new model is applicable to the survival data with varied cluster size and interval censoring. The proposed model allows covariates to be incorporated into both the cure fraction and the latency distribution for the uncured patients. The primary interest is to estimate the marginal parameters in the mean structure, where the correlation structure is treated as nuisance parameters. The marginal parameters are estimated consistently by treating the observations within the cluster as independent. The variances of the parameters are estimated by the one-step jackknife method. The proposed method does not depend on the specification of correlation structure. Simulation studies show that the new method works well when the marginal model is correct. The performance of the MCM is also examined when the clustered survival times share common random effect. The MCM is applied to the data from a smoking cessation study.},

	abstract = {Modern medical treatments have substantially improved survival rates for many chronic diseases and have generated considerable interest in developing cure fraction models for survival data with a non-ignorable cured proportion. Statistical analysis of such data may be further complicated by competing risks that involve multiple types of endpoints. Regression analysis of competing risks is typically undertaken via a proportional hazards model adapted on cause-specific hazard or subdistribution hazard. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that treats competing events as distinct outcomes in a mixture. We consider semiparametric accelerated failure time models for the cause-conditional survival function that are combined through a multinomial logistic model within the cure-mixture modeling framework. The cure-mixture approach to competing risks provides a means to determine the overall effect of a treatment and insights into how this treatment modifies the components of the mixture in the presence of a cure fraction. The regression and nonparametric parameters are estimated by a nonparametric kernel-based maximum likelihood estimation method. Variance estimation is achieved through resampling methods for the kernel-smoothed likelihood function. Simulation studies show that the procedures work well in practical settings. Application to a sarcoma study demonstrates the use of the proposed method for competing risk data with a cure fraction.},

Under a model that incorporates statistical cure, we present the probabilities that cancer patients (1) have died from their cancer, (2) have died from other causes, (3) will eventually die from their cancer, or (4) will eventually die from other causes, all as a function of time since diagnosis. We further demonstrate how conditional probabilities can be used to update the prognosis among survivors (eg, at 1 or 5 years after diagnosis) by summarizing the proportion of patients who will not die from their cancer.

	abstract = {Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The paper is motivated by cure detection among the prostate cancer patients in the National Institutes of Health surveillance epidemiology and end results programme, wherein the main end point (e.g. deaths from prostate cancer) and the censoring causes (e.g. deaths from heart diseases) may be dependent. Although many researchers have studied the mixture survival model to analyse survival data with non-negligible cure fractions, none has studied the mixture cure model in the presence of dependent censoring. To account for such dependence, we propose a more general cure model that allows for dependent censoring. We derive the cure models from the perspective of competing risks and model the dependence between the censoring time and the survival time by using a class of Archimedean copula models. Within this framework, we consider the parameter estimation, the cure detection and the two-sample comparison of latency distributions in the presence of dependent censoring when a proportion of patients is deemed cured. Large sample results by using martingale theory are obtained. We examine the finite sample performance of the proposed methods via simulation and apply them to analyse the surveillance epidemiology and end results prostate cancer data.},

Data with cure fractions often are complicated by dependent censoring, and the analysis of this type of data typically involves untestable parametric assumptions on the dependence of the censoring mechanism and the true survival times. Motivated by the analysis of prostate cancer survival trends, we propose a class of semiparametric transformation cure models that allows for dependent censoring without making parametric assumptions on the dependence relationship. The proposed class of models encompasses a number of common models for the latency survival function, including the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model, and also allows for time-dependent covariates. An inverse censoring probability reweighting scheme is used to derive unbiased estimating equations. Small-sample properties with simulations are derived, and the method is demonstrated with a data application.]},

	abstract = {With explanatory covariates, the standard analysis for competing risks data involves modeling the cause-specific hazard functions via a proportional hazards assumption. Unfortunately, the cause-specific hazard function does not have a direct interpretation in terms of survival probabilities for the particular failure type. In recent years many clinicians have begun using the cumulative incidence function, the marginal failure probabilities for a particular cause, which is intuitively appealing and more easily explained to the nonstatistician. The cumulative incidence is especially relevant in cost-effectiveness analyses in which the survival probabilities are needed to determine treatment utility. Previously, authors have considered methods for combining estimates of the cause-specific hazard functions under the proportional hazards formulation. However, these methods do not allow the analyst to directly assess the effect of a covariate on the marginal probability function. In this article we propose a novel semiparametric proportional hazards model for the subdistribution. Using the partial likelihood principle and weighting techniques, we derive estimation and inference procedures for the finite-dimensional regression parameter under a variety of censoring scenarios. We give a uniformly consistent estimator for the predicted cumulative incidence for an individual with certain covariates; confidence intervals and bands can be obtained analytically or with an easy-to-implement simulation technique. To contrast the two approaches, we analyze a dataset from a breast cancer clinical trial under both models.},

A Bayesian MCMC procedure is developed for parameter estimation and inference. Our method is insensitive to outlying longitudinal measurements in the presence of non-ignorable missing data due to dropout. Moreover, by modeling the variance-covariance matrix of the latent random effects, our model provides a useful framework for handling high-dimensional heterogeneous random effects and testing the homogeneous random effects assumption which is otherwise untestable in commonly used joint models. Finally, our model enables analysis of a survival outcome with intermittently measured time-dependent covariates and possibly correlated competing risks and dependent censoring, as well as joint analysis of the longitudinal and survival outcomes.

Despite the recent methodological developments, there are still limited options for fitting these models in standard statistical software programs, which prohibits their adoption by applied biostatisticians. We summarize four published models, each of which has software available for model estimation. Each model features a different hazard function, latent association structure between the submodels, estimation approach and software implementation. Of the four models considered here, the model specifications and association structures are substantially different, thus complicating model-to-model comparison. The models are applied to the ‘Standard and new anti-epileptic drugs’ trial of anti-epileptic drugs to investigate the effect of drug titration on the treatment effects of lamotrigine and carbamazepine on the mode of treatment failure. Notwithstanding the vastly different association structures, we show that the inference from each model is consistent, namely, that there is a beneficial effect of lamotrigine on unacceptable adverse events over carbamazepine and a non-significant effect on the hazard of inadequate seizure control. The association between anti-epileptic drug titration and treatment failure was significant in most models. To allow for the routine adoption of joint modelling of competing risks and longitudinal data in the analysis of clinical data sets, further work is required on the development of model diagnostics to aid model choice.},

	abstract = {Recently, the joint analysis of longitudinal and survival data has been an active research area. Most joint models focus on survival data with only one type of failure. The research on joint modeling of longitudinal and competing risks survival data is sparse. Even so, many joint models for this type of data assume parametric function forms for both longitudinal and survival sub-models, thus limits their use. Further, the common data features that are usually observed in practice, such as asymmetric distribution and missingness in response, measurement errors in covariate, need to be taken into account for reliable parameter estimation. The statistical inference is complicated when all these factors are considered simultaneously. In the article, driven by a motivating example, we assume nonparametric function forms for the varying coefficients in both longitudinal and competing risks survival sub-models. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric mixed-effects joint model for the analysis of longitudinal-competing risks data with asymmetry, missingness, and measurement errors. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. We apply the proposed method to an AIDS dataset and compare a few candidate models under various settings.

	abstract = {Existing joint models for longitudinal and survival data are not applicable for longitudinal ordinal outcomes with possible non-ignorable missing values caused by multiple reasons. We propose a joint model for longitudinal ordinal measurements and competing risks failure time data, in which a partial proportional odds model for the longitudinal ordinal outcome is linked to the event times by latent random variables. At the survival endpoint, our model adopts the competing risks framework to model multiple failure types at the same time. The partial proportional odds model, as an extension of the popular proportional odds model for ordinal outcomes, is more flexible and at the same time provides a tool to test the proportional odds assumption. We use a likelihood approach and derive an EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. We further show that all the parameters at the survival endpoint are identifiable from the data. Our joint model enables one to make inference for both the longitudinal ordinal outcome and the failure times simultaneously. In addition, the inference at the longitudinal endpoint is adjusted for possible non-ignorable missing data caused by the failure times. We apply the method to the NINDS rt-PA stroke trial. Our study considers the modified Rankin Scale only. Other ordinal outcomes in the trial, such as the Barthel and Glasgow scales, can be treated in the same way.

	abstract = {Joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data is increasingly used in clinical trials on cancer. In prostate cancer for example, these models permit to account for the link between longitudinal measures of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and time of clinical recurrence when studying the risk of relapse. In practice, multiple types of relapse may occur successively. Distinguishing these transitions between health states would allow to evaluate, for example, how PSA trajectory and classical covariates impact the risk of dying after a distant recurrence post-radiotherapy, or to predict the risk of one specific type of clinical recurrence post-radiotherapy, from the PSA history. In this context, we present a joint model for a longitudinal process and a multi-state process, which is divided into two sub-models: a linear mixed sub-model for longitudinal data and a multi-state sub-model with proportional hazards for transition times, both linked by a function of shared random effects. Parameters of this joint multi-state model are estimated within the maximum likelihood framework using an EM algorithm coupled with a quasi-Newton algorithm in case of slow convergence. It is implemented under R, by combining and extending mstate and JM packages. The estimation program is validated by simulations and applied on pooled data from two cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer. Thanks to the classical covariates available at baseline and the repeated PSA measurements, we are able to assess the biomarker's trajectory, define the risks of transitions between health states and quantify the impact of the PSA dynamics on each transition intensity.

The competing risk of death must be considered in the elderly because death and dementia have common risk factors. Moreover, in cohort studies, time-to-dementia is interval-censored since dementia is assessed intermittently. So subjects can develop dementia and die between two visits without being diagnosed. To study predementia cognitive decline, we propose a joint latent class model combining a (possibly multivariate) mixed model and an illness-death model handling both interval censoring (by accounting for a possible unobserved transition to dementia) and semi-competing risks. Parameters are estimated by maximum-likelihood handling interval censoring. The correlation between the marker and the times-to-events is captured by latent classes, homogeneous sub-groups with specific risks of death, dementia, and profiles of cognitive decline. We propose Markovian and semi-Markovian versions. Both approaches are compared to a joint latent-class model for competing risks through a simulation study, and applied in a prospective cohort study of cerebral and functional ageing to distinguish different profiles of cognitive decline associated with risks of dementia and death. The comparison highlights that among subjects with dementia, mortality depends more on age than on duration of dementia. This model distinguishes the so-called terminal predeath decline (among healthy subjects) from the predementia decline.},

Dynamic area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Brier Score (BS) are used to quantify predictive accuracy. Nonparametric inverse probability of censoring weighting is used to estimate dynamic curves of AUC and BS as functions of the time at which predictions are made. Asymptotic results are established and both pointwise confidence intervals and simultaneous confidence bands are derived. Tests are also proposed to compare the dynamic prediction accuracy curves of two prognostic models. The finite sample behavior of the inference procedures is assessed via simulations.

	abstract = {Joint models initially dedicated to a single longitudinal marker and a single time-to-event need to be extended to account for the rich longitudinal data of cohort studies. Multiple causes of clinical progression are indeed usually observed, and multiple longitudinal markers are collected when the true latent trait of interest is hard to capture (e.g., quality of life, functional dependency, and cognitive level). These multivariate and longitudinal data also usually have nonstandard distributions (discrete, asymmetric, bounded, etc.). We propose a joint model based on a latent process and latent classes to analyze simultaneously such multiple longitudinal markers of different natures, and multiple causes of progression. A latent process model describes the latent trait of interest and links it to the observed longitudinal outcomes using flexible measurement models adapted to different types of data, and a latent class structure links the longitudinal and cause-specific survival models. The joint model is estimated in the maximum likelihood framework. A score test is developed to evaluate the assumption of conditional independence of the longitudinal markers and each cause of progression given the latent classes. In addition, individual dynamic cumulative incidences of each cause of progression based on the repeated marker data are derived. The methodology is validated in a simulation study and applied on real data about cognitive aging obtained from a large population-based study. The aim is to predict the risk of dementia by accounting for the competing death according to the profiles of semantic memory measured by two asymmetric psychometric tests.

	abstract = {Survival analysis arises in many fields of study including medicine, biology, engineering, public health, epidemiology, and economics. This book provides a comprehensive treatment of Bayesian survival analysis.Several topics are addressed, including parametric models, semiparametric models based on prior processes, proportional and non-proportional hazards models, frailty models, cure rate models, model selection and comparison, joint models for longitudinal and survival data, models with time varying covariates, missing covariate data, design and monitoring of clinical trials, accelerated failure time models, models for mulitivariate survival data, and special types of hierarchial survival models. Also various censoring schemes are examined including right and interval censored data. Several additional topics are discussed, including noninformative and informative prior specificiations, computing posterior qualities of interest, Bayesian hypothesis testing, variable selection, model selection with nonnested models, model checking techniques using Bayesian diagnostic methods, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for sampling from the posteiror and predictive distributions.The book presents a balance between theory and applications, and for each class of models discussed, detailed examples and analyses from case studies are presented whenever possible.

Attention is focused on inference concerning the effects of factors on both the probability of occurrence and the hazard rate conditional on each of the failure types. These two quantities are specified in the mixture model using the logistic model and the proportional hazards model, respectively. We propose a semi-parametric mixture method to estimate the logistic and regression coefficients jointly, whereby the component-baseline hazard functions are completely unspecified. Estimation is based on maximum likelihood on the basis of the full likelihood, implemented via an expectation-conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm. Simulation studies are performed to compare the performance of the proposed semi-parametric method with a fully parametric mixture approach. The results show that when the component-baseline hazard is monotonic increasing, the semi-parametric and fully parametric mixture approaches are comparable for mildly and moderately censored samples. When the component-baseline hazard is not monotonic increasing, the semi-parametric method consistently provides less biased estimates than a fully parametric approach and is comparable in efficiency in the estimation of the parameters for all levels of censoring. The methods are illustrated using a real data set of prostate cancer patients treated with different dosages of the drug diethylstilbestrol.},

In this article, we consider an efficient semiparametric analysis of mixture component models on cumulative incidence functions. Under the proposed mixture model, latency survival regressions given the event type are performed through a class of semiparametric models that encompasses the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model, allowing for time-dependent covariates. The marginal proportions of the occurrences of cause-specific events are assessed by a multinomial logistic model. Our mixture modeling approach is advantageous in that it makes a joint estimation of model parameters associated with all competing risks under consideration, satisfying the constraint that the cumulative probability of failing from any cause adds up to one given any covariates. We develop a novel maximum likelihood scheme based on semiparametric regression analysis that facilitates efficient and reliable estimation. Statistical inferences can be conveniently made from the inverse of the observed information matrix. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. We validate small sample properties with simulations and demonstrate the methodology with a data set from a study of follicular lymphoma.},

In this paper, we introduce a flexible parametric mixture model as a unifying method to obtain estimates of the cause-specific and subdistribution hazards and hazard-ratio functions. We describe how these estimates can be summarized over time to give a single number comparable to the hazard ratio that is obtained from a corresponding cause-specific or subdistribution proportional hazards model.

	abstract = {Summary. Cancer is a major public health burden and is the second leading cause of death in the USA. The US National Cancer Institute estimated overall costs of cancer in 2007 at \$219.2 billion. Breast cancer has the highest cancer incidence rates among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. The ‘Surveillance, epidemiology, and end results’ programme of the National Cancer Institute collects and publishes cancer survival data from 17 population-based cancer registries. The CANSURV software of the National Cancer Institute analyses cancer survival data from the programme by using parametric and semiparametric mixture cure models. Another popular approach in cancer survival is the competing risks approach which considers the simultaneous risks from cancer and various other causes. The paper develops a model that unifies the mixture cure and competing risks approaches and that can handle the masked causes of death in a natural way. Markov chain sampling is used for Bayesian analysis of this model, and modelling and computational issues of general and restricted structures are discussed. The various model structures are compared by using Bayes factors. This Bayesian model is used to analyse survival data for the approximately 620000 breast cancer cases from the programme. The estimated cumulative probabilities of death from breast cancer from the proposed mixture cure competing risks model is found to be lower than the estimates that are obtained from the CANSURV software. Whereas the estimate of the cure fraction is found to be dependent on the modelling assumptions, the survival and cumulative probability estimates are not sensitive to these assumptions. Breast cancer survival in different ethnic subgroups, in different age subgroups and in patients with localized, regional and distant stages of the disease are compared. The risk of mortality from breast cancer is found to be the dominant cause of death in the beginning part of the follow-up whereas the risk from other competing causes often became the dominant cause in the latter part. This interrelation between breast cancer and other competing risks varies among the different ethnic groups, the different stages and the different age groups.},
